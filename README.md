**NeoLAT** is a specialized testbed designed for evaluating and experimenting with Local Agentic AI systems. It provides a robust environment for comparing performance across different local inference engines (MLX-based PyTorch, Ollama) and testing cognitive capabilities on tasks like Sudoku, ARC-1, and ARC-2.

## 1. 🌟 Mission: Bridging the Gap for Mission-Critical Local AI

NeoLAT is not just a testbed; it’s a crucible for the next generation of AI agents that must operate where the cloud cannot reach. We focus on safety, speed, and local autonomy for environments where failure is not an option.

## 2. 🚀 Key Features

- **Local Inference Focus**: Optimized for running powerful models locally on Apple Silicon (via MLX) and other platforms.
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of agents, environments, analysis tools, and core logic.
- **Experimentation Framework**: Integrated with [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) for configuration management and [WandB](https://wandb.ai/) for experiment tracking.
- **Cognitive Benchmarks**: Includes environments for testing high-level reasoning and problem-solving skills.
- **Documentation First**: Built with extensive MkDocs integration for clear and accessible documentation.

## 4. 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Conda**: Anaconda or Miniconda installed on your system.
- **OS**: optimized for macOS (Apple Silicon), but compatible with Linux/Windows.

### Quick Start

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/neomakes/neolat.git
    cd neolat
    ```

2.  **Run the setup script:**
    This script creates a Conda environment named `neolat` (Python 3.11), installs dependencies, and registers the Jupyter kernel.

    ```bash
    chmod +x setup_env.sh
    ./setup_env.sh
    ```

3.  **Activate the environment:**
    ```bash
    conda activate neolat
    ```

## 5. 📖 Usage

### Running Documentation

To view the project documentation locally:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

Then navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.

## 6. 🤝 Contributing

We are looking for engineers who want to push the boundaries of Local AI. By contributing to NeoLAT, you will:
- **Master On-Device Optimization**: Gain rare expertise in MLX, quantization, and local inference.
- **Solve Real-World Constraints**: Design agents for high-stakes, resource-constrained environments.
- **Shape the Future of Privacy**: Help build a world where powerful AI doesn't require an internet connection.

Join us in defining the standard for reliable, local agentic intelligence.
